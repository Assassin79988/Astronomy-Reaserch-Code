# Astronomy-Reaserch-Code

This repository contains a series of scripts I will be using. Below is an ungoing description of the purpose of each script.

<b>fits.py</b> <br>
 <ul>This script contains a series of useful function to open, close and get infomation from .FITS files.</ul>
 
 <b>calcPhysicalDist.py</b> <br>
  <ul>This script contains a series of function to calculation the phsyical distance between two point on the sky with a known RA, Dec and redshift. Two methods of finding the projected distance is included i.e. Great Circle arc method and a plane approx. the plate scale (kPc/ arcseconds) is found using functions from comoscalc.</ul>
